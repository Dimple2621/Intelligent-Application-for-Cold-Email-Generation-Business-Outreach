In this role, you'll supervise hourly team members, handle any escalations, and collaborate with store associates to keep everything on track. Plus, you'll embrace the travel that comes with the job.\n\n\nWalmart truly stands out as the best place to build a career from the ground up. No other company can rival our combination of making a massive impact and our culture of promoting from within, from entry\\-level roles all the way to executive positions. Thanks to our unique mix of career pathways, perks, and pay, you can craft just about any career you dream of here, no matter where you start or what you aspire to achieve.\n\n**Why You'll Love This Role:**\n\n* **Leading Others:** Motivate your team to meet timelines and deliverables on projects. Encourage collaboration and teamwork among associates. Reinforce what teamwork looks like by resolving store leadership, supplier, and associate concerns.\n* **Project Ownership:** Own the execution of projects in your assigned stores. Communicate plans, changes, and obstacles to key stakeholders. Understand plans and minimize impact on store operations.\n* **Develop Associates:** Provide supervision and development opportunities for your team members. Spend time listening and acting on ideas, suggestions, questions, or concerns. Evaluate talent, train and mentor, provide recognition, and identify career paths for associates.\n\n**Your Resume Will Stand Out With:**\n\n* Demonstrated knowledge of construction remodels, project management, space management, and/or store design.\n* Experience with leading people, projects, initiatives, or leading cross\\-functional teams.\n\n**Shift:** Primarily working overnights; night shifts average from 10 to 12 hours.\n\n**Travel:** Frequent travel up to 1000 miles from home is a role requirement. Expect to be away from home 80% of the time, or for 17\\-21 days at a time. Travel areas are based on project workload and will change as the business needs.

This role demands mastery of reliability, availability, software engineering, and best practices in BCDR.\n\n**Position Description**\n\n\nOur Distinguished Engineer works with Principal and Senior Engineers to innovate and build new systems, dramatically improve, and enhance existing systems, and identify new opportunities to apply deep knowledge to solve critical enterprise problems. You will lead the technical strategy and execution of a roadmap that increases product delivery velocity while ensuring absolute platform resilience.

      "description": "**About us**\n\n  \n\nAt ExxonMobil, our vision is to lead in energy innovations that advance modern living and a net\\-zero future. As one of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded energy and chemical companies, we are powered by a unique and diverse workforce fueled by the pride in what we do and what we stand for.\n\n  \n\nThe success of our Upstream, Product Solutions and Low Carbon Solutions businesses is the result of the talent, curiosity and drive of our people. They bring solutions every day to optimize our strategy in energy, chemicals, lubricants and lower\\-emissions technologies.\n\n  \n\nWe invite you to bring your ideas to ExxonMobil to help create sustainable solutions that improve quality of life and meet society\u2019s evolving needs. Learn more about **our What and our Why** and how we canwork **together**.\n\n**About Baytown**\n-----------------\n\n  \n\nWith a population of more than 77,000, Baytown, Texas, is located in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, just east of Houston, the nation's fourth largest city. Those who live and work in Baytown will find an area rich in history, as well as opportunities for outdoor activities due to its proximity to scenic waterways, namely Galveston Bay, the San Jacinto River and Buffalo Bayou.  \n\nFounded in 1919, ExxonMobil's Baytown Complex is located on approximately 3,400 acres along the Houston Ship Channel, about 25 miles east of Houston. Employing a workforce of more than 8,500, it is comprised of four manufacturing sites, including one in nearby Mont Belvieu, and a global technology center. These include the Baytown Refinery, one of the largest refineries in the United States, and the Baytown Olefins Plant, one of the largest ethylene plants in the world.  \n\nIts scope of products includes fuels, lube oils, and chemical compounds used in a diverse range of products, from auto battery cases, diapers and tire inner tubes to pharmaceutical uses, food packaging, trash bags and more.  \n\nThe Baytown area sites are highly integrated, which makes the plants and products more efficient as we develop technologies to make cleaner fuels and work together to operate more safely and reliably.  \n\nLearn more about what we do in Baytown **here.**\n\n**What role you will play in our team**\n---------------------------------------\n\n  \n\nThe Polymers Process Improve Engineer is a Technology employee embedded in Manufacturing sites to provide technology support for the Manufaturing Organization. Primary responsibilities include supporting process \\& product deployments to site, providing technical leadership, and engaging within the global technology networks to provide sharings \\& implement learnings. This role can cover either polymerization and/or extrusion technologies.\"\n\n  \n\n\"Include the location(s) of the job (city \\& state); if city \\& state is undetermined, listing the geographic area is acceptable Baytown Area\"\n\n**What you will do**\n--------------------\n\n  \n\nImprove Engineers (IEs) are Technology employees embedded in the Manufacturing (MFG) sites to provide technology support for the MFG organization. They have four primary responsibilities:\n\n  \n\n* Lead site performance improvement activities to close gaps between best site performance and best\\-in\\-network performance\n* Support process \\& product technology deployments to the site\n* Provide technical leadership in mentoring, problem solving, \\& unit monitoring\n* Engage process networks to share learnings \\& best practices between sites\n\n  \n\nPer these basic responsibilities IEs are often key contributors to process efficiency improvements, capacity optimization activities, capital \\& expense project development, process \\& product plant trial programs, equipment \\& engineering change reviews, and incident investigations.  \n\nIEs are generally expected to dedicate at least a minority component of their time to base site support. The extent depends on the prioritized balance of site needs vs. technology commitments vs. individual development opportunities for the IE. The last distinction is important because certain base tasks assumed by an experienced IE may not be appropriate for their successor\u2019s career development objectives.\"\n\n**About You**\n-------------\n\n **Skills and Qualifications**\n\n  \n\n* Strong technical, analytical, and problem solving skills\n* Experience with process optimization/control/troubleshooting, process equipment, facility projects\n* Provide technical mentoring for less experienced colleagues and newly appointed supervisors\n* Able to effectively deliver on primary responsibilities with limited line management oversight\n* Strong verbal \\& written communication skills\n* Effectively present clear and data driven recommendations\n* Ability to navigate organizational boundaries and develop influence without direct authority\n* Ability to work in strict adherence to Manufacturing safety rules, safety systems, and Management of Change\n* Display sound business judgment as well as risk assessment skills (in particular in SHE and IP areas), with the ability to balance own ideas and insights against business needs\n* Bachelor or Master of Science degree in Engineering (typ. Chemical or Mechanical but others accepted)\n\n **Preferred Qualifications / Experience:**\n\n  \n\n* Demonstrated work experience in polymers manufacturing environment\n* Demonstrated work experience in new process and/or products technology trials\n* Experience with data analytics software (SeeQ, PI, Uniformance)\n**Your benefits**\n-----------------\n\n **An ExxonMobil career is one designed to last.
